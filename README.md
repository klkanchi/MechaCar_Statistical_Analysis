## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. Using your knowledge of R, youâ€™ll design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file.

### To Deliver.

1. The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe
2. An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables
3. An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values
4. There is a summary that addresses all three questions

Resulting lm Model:

**mpg = (6.267)vehicle_length + (0.0012)vehicle_weight + (0.0688)spoiler_angle + (3.546)ground_clearance + (-3.411)AWD + (-104.0)**

From the above output we can see that:

The vehicle length, and vehicle ground clearance are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the model. That is to say, the vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon on the MechaCar prototype. Conversely, the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and All Wheel Drive (AWD) have p-Values that indicate a random amount of variance with the dataset.

The p-Value for this model, p-Value: 5.35e-11, is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which further indcates that the slope of this linear model is not zero.

This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. Relatively speaking, his multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

If we remove the less impactful independent variables (vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and All Wheel Drive), the predictability does decrease, but not drastically: the r-squared value falls from 0.7149 to 0.674.

The Suspension Coil dataset provided for the MechaCar contains the results of testing the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils from multiple production lots to determine consistency.

With the understanding that the design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils mandate that the variance of the suspension coils cannot exceed 100 pounds per square inch (PSI) .

Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

When looking at the entire population of the production lot, the variance of the coils is 62.29 PSI, which is well within the 100 PSI variance requirement.

Similarly, but significantly more consistent, Lot 1 and Lot 2 are well within the 100 PSI variance requirement; with variances of 0.98 and 7.47 respectively. However, it is Lot 3 that is showing much larger variance in performance and consistency, with a variance of 170.29. It is Lot 3 that is disproportionately causing the variance at the full lot level.


## Delivearble3
There is a summary of the t-test results across all manufacturing lots d3

From here we can see the true mean of the sample is 1498.78, which we also saw in the summary statistics above. With a p-Value of 0.06, which is higher than the common significance level of 0.05, there is NOT enough evidence to support rejecting the null hypothesis. That is to say, the mean of all three of these manufacturing lots is statistically similar to the presumed population mean of 1500.


Next looking at each individual lots:

Lot 1 sample actually has the true sample mean of 1500, again as we saw in the summary statistics above. With a p-Value of 1, clearly we cannot reject (i.e. accept) the null hypothesis that there is no statistical difference between the observed sample mean and the presumed population mean (1500).
Lot 2 has essentially the same outcome with a sample mean of 1500.02, a p-Value of 0.61; the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, and the sample mean and the population mean of 1500 are statistically similar.
However, Lot 3, not surprisingly is a different scenario. Here the sample mean is 1496.14 and the p-Value is 0.04, which is lower than the common significance level of 0.05. All indicating to reject the null hypothesis that this sample mean and the presumed population mean are not statistically different.

How does this information help? Clearly, something went awry in Lot 3's production cycle. The process needs to be checked for system fails and the suspension coils from this lot need to be inspected to remove those not meeting quality criteria.
